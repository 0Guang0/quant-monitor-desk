# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:

- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

## Plan gate (complex tasks with `MASTER.plan.md`, `status=planning`)

When authoring or freezing a complex task plan:

1. **MUST Read first:** `.cursor/skills/trellis-plan/SKILL.md` — complete **Phase P0 Boot** (including **P0o** `docs/implementation_tasks/` original plan package) before MASTER §8–§12.
2. Follow **Phases 1a→5d** in `complex-task-planning-protocol.md` §4；append `research/plan-skill-reads.jsonl` per Read.
3. Produce `research/original-plan-trace.md` mapping `NNN_*.md` → MASTER §2 AC.
4. Before `task.py start`: `python .trellis/scripts/task.py validate-plan-freeze <task-dir>` exit 0.
5. Optional per phase: `python .trellis/scripts/task.py validate-plan-phase <task-dir> <phase>`.

## Execute gate (complex tasks with `MASTER.plan.md`)

When the active task status is `in_progress` and the task directory contains `MASTER.plan.md`:

1. **MUST Read first:** `.cursor/skills/trellis-execute/SKILL.md` — complete **Phase 0 Boot** before any business code.
2. Read **MASTER §0.1** state machine and **§12** Skill table (paths in `.trellis/spec/guides/execute-skill-paths.yaml`).
3. Execute **one §8.x step at a time**: Read TDD skill → RED (must FAIL) → `execute-evidence/{step}-red.txt` → GREEN → `{step}-green.txt` → `[x]`.
4. After each GREEN: Read **incremental-implementation**; full pytest must pass before next §8 step.
5. After RED, before GREEN implementation: Read **karpathy-guidelines** (§5 ladder + §1-4) and **testing-guidelines** (§12 + paths yaml).
6. Run GitNexus **`impact()`** before editing symbols; **`detect_changes()`** before commit.
7. Do **not** run `trellis-check` during Execute — Audit Phase 7 / A1 replaces it.
8. Optional per step: `python .trellis/scripts/task.py validate-execute-step <task-dir> 8.x`
9. Before §11 Audit handoff: `python .trellis/scripts/task.py validate-execute-handoff <task-dir>`.
10. Do **not** `finish-work` until Audit PASS.

## Repair/Debt Lite Worktree Protocol

When a user asks to close already-audited findings, registry debt, or repair follow-ups, do not restart the full complex Plan by default. First check `.trellis/spec/guides/complex-task-planning-protocol.md` Phase 8D.

Use Repair/Debt Lite only when the item already has an audit/registry source of truth, can be sliced independently, does not add schema/public API/new production source behavior, and does not require production DB writes. The main session must produce a lightweight slice plan with owner, base branch, target branch, allowed files, forbidden files, verification, evidence path, and merge gate before implementation or worktree creation.

For parallel agents: one worktree per agent, one branch per slice or tightly related slice group, and no two active branches may own the same core file group. Registry files should normally be reconciled by a merge coordinator rather than edited concurrently by many agents.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **quant-monitor-desk** (6263 symbols, 10281 relationships, 276 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
